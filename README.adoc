This is workshop material for building modern RESTful Hypermedia driven web services with Spring.

== Requirements

* Java 8 or later (JDK) installed

For the Angular lab, you don't need to install Node.js and all the JavaScript tooling,
since those tools are installed automatically by the Gradle build.
It would be convenient to have those tools installed
if you want to use them directly instead of using the Gradle wrapper tasks.

* Optional: Node.js and npm installed

== Getting Started

When you want to run the workshop labs locally, prepare all the labs:

* ./gradlew clean build _(builds all the tutorial labs and runs all the tests)_

== License
